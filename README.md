## Overview

## The Challenge

- [ ] The names of the author and photo location should be fetched from the API
- [ ] Used a tint overlay on top of the images to give the text good contrast, should an image have a light background
- [ ] User should see loading placeholders when data is being fetched from the API

To get data from API you can check [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) in javascript.
